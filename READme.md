## Description
#### Dennis Checkers game has been designed using Python and Pycharm framework. Opponents play against each other until one wins. A player win the game if all the opponent's pieces get depleted hence can't be able to move across the board.
#### To play this game, players need to press the run button on their computer or laptop to see the checkers board. The players are identified by red and white pieces. The red piece player starts the move then followed by the white piece player. The process continues simultaneously until one wins the game. One piece can't move back until before reaching the opposite end where it will be referred as a King
#### The files that have been used to design this project are: game, board, main, piece, and constant python files. The game file controls the rules of the game to ensure that players make the right moves. The constant file contains items that are unchanged while designing the game. This includes the height, width, colors, rows, and columns of the game. 
#### The board file designs the layout of the game. This includes the size and colors of squares. The piece file designs the size and shape of pieces that shows players movement across the board. The main file combine all the files together to run the project.
